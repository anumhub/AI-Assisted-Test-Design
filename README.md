### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Generative AI can be effectively used by a QA Analyst to accelerate test planning, test case design, test data generation, and test strategy alignment from high-level product requirements.

---

###  Problem Statement

- Manual test planning and test case creation are time-consuming
- Early QA phases often delay feedback to product teams
- Test strategy decisions are inconsistently documented

---

###  Solution Approach

- Used Generative AI (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude) to:
    - Convert requirements into structured test plans
    - Generate functional test cases in tabular format
    - Create test data combinations
    - Design end-to-end functional test flows
    - Map test cases to test pyramid layers

---

###  Key Capabilities Demonstrated

- AI-assisted test planning from requirements
- Functional test case generation (User Accounts, Product Catalog)
- Test data generation aligned with scenarios
- End-to-end test flow creation
- Test pyramid strategy mapping
- LLM-agnostic prompt design

---
